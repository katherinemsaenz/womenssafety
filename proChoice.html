<h4> Gabriella </h4>
<p> “People like me who have experienced harm and trauma from society
and interpersonal relationships are best equipped to make decisions for the world and themselves, especially when it comes to our bodies. I consider myself a changemaker and my passion for advocacy comes from my personal experience having to fight for myself and my rights. These photos embody the ways I am gentle with myself and attune to my own healing and growth after my abortion. I have found ways to reclaim my power, my agency, and I feel inspired to help others do the same. </p>
<h4> Tamara </h4>
<p>"To all of the people that say that abortion complications are a reason to rob people of the right to have abortions: I had abortion complications and I never once have regretted my decision to have an abortion. I am grateful to be in a position now in which I spend my full-time job advocating for abortion access.”</p>

<h4> Jessy </h4>
<p>
“After my abortion, and after much time, there was a moment of relief
and peace. I came to terms that I made the right decision. That moment
of my shame being lifted off me was so liberating.”
</p>

<p>
“Now I stand my ground. I’ll stand in the frontline and share my story
in order to change the culture around abortion. I had an abortion.”
</p>

<h4> Elizabeth </h4>
<p>
“My story is one of self preservation, grief, emotions, interconnectedness and self love. My story includes the duality of life and death, loneliness and community, nostalgia and joy. Among all these things, my choice to have an abortion is one of the most powerful and life giving choices I have ever made for myself.”
</p>
<h4> Syria </h4>
<p>
“I became pregnant during my first semester of grad school. I ended up getting an abortion on my first anniversary with my boyfriend...all in the middle of finals week! It’s a decision I’m incredibly grateful I made.”
</p>
<p>
“As a South Asian woman, though, I still struggle with it. I’m sharing my story because I directly know the difference that sharing a story can make.”
</p>

<h4> Renee and Daniela </h4>
<p>
I wasn’t ready to be a parent, a mother, nor did I have the financial capacity or support to be a single parent. Support and financial capacity aside, I knew I wasn’t ready. Abortion was completely demystified for me.
</p>
<p>
  “The friendships I’ve made as a result of sharing my story have nourished my soul. There's an unspoken understanding in the friendships that I’ve made by sharing my story: the value of bodily autonomy, how empowering it is, and empathy for the circumstances that led us to getting an abortion.” - Daniela
