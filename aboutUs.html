    <h2> Safe Women = Better World </h2>


<h3>About Us</h3>
    <h4> Meet The Team!</h4>

    <p>“A woman is in full circle. Within her is the           power to create, nurture and transform.”

    <p>
      On average 1 out of 5 women encounter                 uncomfortable,non-consensual experiences, and         most of these cases do not get reported at all.       These women tend to feel unsafe when undergoing       these experiences so our team has decided to          create a web application that works in these           women’s favors. This is an all inclusive women       designed web application that will push for the       idea of women of all color, race, and age to          feel safe.
